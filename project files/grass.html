Medications: Over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines, nasal sprays (corticosteroid or saline), and decongestants can help manage symptoms.
Immunotherapy: Allergy shots (SCIT) or tablets/drops under the tongue (SLIT) can help build tolerance to the allergen.
Consult a doctor: If symptoms are severe or persistent, or if you suspect an allergy, consult a doctor or allergist for proper diagnosis and treatment options. 
Important note: People with asthma should be aware that grass pollen can worsen their symptoms.
