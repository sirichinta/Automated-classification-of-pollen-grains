    <h3>Characteristics seen in images:</h3>
Spiky outer wall (exine): The outer wall of a sunflower pollen grain is characterized by sharp, pointed projections or spikes. This feature aids in dispersal by helping the pollen grains stick to pollinating insects.
Unique surface patterns: The specific ornamentation of pollen grains is used by botanists for plant recognition and classification.
Male gamete: Each pollen grain contains the male gamete, a reproductive cell that, when fertilized, contributes to the formation of a new seed. 
<h3>Examples of images:</h3>
