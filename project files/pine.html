    <h1>PINE POLLEN</h1>
    <p>Pine pollen grains have a distinctive appearance, characterized by the presence of two air sacs or "wings" that aid in wind dispersal. These air sacs provide buoyancy, allowing the pollen grains to be carried by wind currents over considerable distances. 
Here's a breakdown of what pine pollen looks like in different contexts:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Released Pollen: Pine trees release vast amounts of pollen, especially in spring, creating a yellow dust that can be seen on various surfaces like cars, sidewalks, and even in the air.</li>
            <li>Male Pine Cones: Images of male pine cones (strobili) show the structures that release the pollen.</li>
            <li>Pine Pollen in Water: Pine pollen is a significant component in water bodies like the Baltic Sea, particularly in late spring, and its presence can even affect remote sensing measurements. </li>
