    <h1>Brich Pollen</h1>
    <p>Birch pollen, primarily from birch trees, is a major trigger for seasonal allergies, particularly in Northern and Central Europe and North America. It's a common cause of hay fever (allergic rhinitis) symptoms like:</p>

        Sneezing
Runny or stuffy nose
Itchy, watery, or swollen eyes
Headache
Fatigue
Wheezing or difficulty breathing (for people with allergic asthma) 
Key Allergen:
Bet v 1: This is the primary allergen found in birch pollen and is responsible for triggering allergic reactions in most sensitized individuals. 
Pollen-Food Allergy Syndrome (PFAS) / Oral Allergy Syndrome (OAS):
Individuals with birch pollen allergies may also experience PFAS (or OAS) after eating certain raw fruits, vegetables, or nuts that contain proteins similar to those in birch pollen.
Symptoms of PFAS include:
Tingly or itchy mouth, lips, or throat
Swelling of the lips, mouth, tongue, or throat
Hives in the mouth
Common PFAS triggers for birch pollen allergy sufferers include apples, peaches, cherries, almonds, and hazelnuts. Generally, cooking these foods denatures the allergenic proteins, making them safe to eat for those with PFAS. 
Treatment:
Medications: Over-the-counter and prescription antihistamines, decongestants, and nasal sprays (including corticosteroids) can help manage birch pollen allergy symptoms.
Immunotherapy: Allergy shots (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) can help desensitize the immune system to birch pollen over time, potentially reducing or eliminating symptoms.
Avoidance: Reduce exposure to birch pollen by staying indoors when pollen counts are high, closing windows, using air conditioning, and wearing a mask and sunglasses outdoors. 
Important Notes:
The birch pollen season typically occurs in spring, between March and June.
Birch pollen can travel long distances on the wind, so symptoms can occur even if there are no birch trees nearby.
Individuals with birch pollen allergies may also have reactions to other tree pollens like alder and hazel due to cross-reactivity.
